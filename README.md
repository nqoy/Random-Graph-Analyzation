# Random_Graph_Analyzation

Creation of N randomly generated, undirected graphs with 1000 vertices (vertex connection is formed by a probability threshold).  
Simulation and Investigation of each graph Properties (connectivity, diameter, single vertex) with garph algoritems.  
Writing data into CVS ('1' or '0' for each graph attribute rule)
Conclusion building and Presentation of the collected data.
